            <p class="direction">[_Eying her._] Well, I'd like to know where you get _that_
            from. Not from your mother and me. _We_ like them, don't we, Emily? Why,
            your mother's hardly ever even left here--but you had to up and get out.</p>
            
            <h6 class="MARY">MARY</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Yes. That's right, father; I _had_ to.</p>
