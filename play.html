        <h6>TRADITION BY GEORGE MIDDLETON</h6>
        <p>MARY. [_Shuddering._] I hate associations.
  <br>
            OLLIVANT. [_Eying her._] Well, I'd like to know where you get _that_
            from. Not from your mother and me. _We_ like them, don't we, Emily? Why,
            your mother's hardly ever even left here--but you had to up and get out.
            <br>
            MARY. Yes. That's right, father; I _had_ to.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. [_He stops smoking and looks at her sharply._] Had to? Who
            made you?
            <br>
            MARY. [_Reluctantly._] It was something inside me.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. [_In spite of himself._] Tush--that foolishness.
            <br>
            MARY. [_Quickly._] Don't make it hard for us again.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. I made it hard, Mary? Because I objected to your leaving your
            mother here alone?
            <br>
            MARY. I remember; you said I was a foolish, "stage-struck" girl.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. Well, you're over _that_, aren't you?
            <br>
            MARY. That's just where you are mistaken, father. [_Slowly._] That's why
            I asked you if you hadn't misunderstood my coming back.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. [_Suspiciously._] Then why did you come at all?
            <br>
            MARY. I'm human; I wanted to see you and mother, so I came when you
            generously wrote me. I'm not going to stay and spray the roses.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. [_He eyes her tensely and controls himself with an effort._]
            So you are not going to stay with your mother and me?
            <br>
            MARY. [_Affectionately._] I'll come see you as often as I can and----
            <br>
            OLLIVANT.--and make a hotel of your home? [MARY _is silent_.] Don't you
            see your mother is getting older and needs somebody to be here?
            <br>
            EMILY. [_With a quiet assurance._] I have never been so well and
            contented.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. [_Tenderly._] I know better, Emily; can't I see you're getting
            thinner and older? [_Stopping her protests._] Now, let me manage this,
            dear. It's a girl's place to stay at home. You know my feelings about
            that. Suppose anything should happen to your mother, what would _I_ do?
            <br>
            MARY. So it's not mother alone you are thinking of?
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. [_Tersely._] I'm thinking of your place at home--doing a
            woman's work. I'm not proud of having my daughter off earning her own
            living as though I couldn't support her.
            <br>
            EMILY. George!
            <br>
            MARY. I thought it was only because I was on the stage.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. Well, it's not the most heavenly place, is it? A lot of
            narrow-minded fools here in town thought I was crazy to _let_ you go; I
            knew how they felt; I grinned and bore it. You were my daughter and I
            loved you, and I didn't want them to think any less of you by their
            finding out you were leaving against my wish.
            <br>
            MARY. [_Slowly, with comprehension._] That's what hurt you.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. Well, I blamed myself a bit for taking you to plays and liking
            them myself.
            <br>
            MARY. People here will soon forget about me and merely be sorry for you.
            <br>
            OLLIVANT. [_Persuasively._] Why, Mary. I've made it easy for you</p>
