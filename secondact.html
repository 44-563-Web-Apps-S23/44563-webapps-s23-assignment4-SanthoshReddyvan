        <p class="direction">[_Shuddering._] I hate associations.</p>
  
            <h6 class="OLLIVANT">OLLIVANT</h6> 
            <p class="direction">[_Eying her._] Well, I'd like to know where you get _that_
            from. Not from your mother and me. _We_ like them, don't we, Emily? Why,
            your mother's hardly ever even left here--but you had to up and get out.</p>
            
            <h6 class="MARY">MARY</h6>
            <p class="speech"> Yes. That's right, father; I _had_ to.</p>
            
            <h6 class="OLLIVANT">OLLIVANT</h6>
            <p class="diretion">[_He stops smoking and looks at her sharply._] Had to? Who
            made you?

            <h6 class="MARY">MARY</h6>
            <p class="direction">[_Reluctantly._] It was something inside me.
                </p>
            
            <h6 class="OLLIVANT">OLLIVANT</h6>
            <p class="direction">[_In spite of himself._] Tush--that foolishness.
            </p>
            
            <h6 class="MARY">MARY</h6> 
            <p class="direction">[_Quickly._] Don't make it hard for us again.
               </p>

            <h6 class="OLLIVANT">OLLIVANT</h6> 
            <p class="speech">I made it hard, Mary? Because I objected to your leaving your
            mother here alone?</p>
        
            <h6 class="MARY">MARY</h6> 
            <p class ="speech">I remember; you said I was a foolish, "stage-struck" girl.
